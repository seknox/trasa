Some of the services assigned to you might need explicit request to Admin.  

If a service has a red shield icon, you need to ask your administrator for temporary access.
To do that,

- Click the “Request Access” button
<img  alt="adhoc-service" src={('/img/docs/user-guides/access/adhoc-service.png')} />

- Choose an admin to request access.
- Enter the reason to access the server.
- Click "Submit Request".
<img  alt="adhoc-request" src={('/img/docs/user-guides/access/adhoc-request.png')} />

You will get an email notification when the admin responds to your request.
