 When your administrator configures the access proxy, you can access RDP service only via the TRASA dashboard.

 If the access proxy is not configured and only the TRASAWIN 2fa agent is configured, you can access remote computers with any regular RDP client you have been using.

## Direct Access
When the windows server or workstation is protected with TRASA 2FA agent, just after the username(privilege) and password is validated in the windows logon screen, a prompt will appear on your screen.

You will have to enter your trasaID(email or username) and select the TFA method to perform second step verification.

* Open up the console menu. The copied text will appear in the clipboard.
* Select the text in the clipboard and right-click on it and select copy (You can't use Ctrl+C). 
* Now you can paste the text in the local PC.

To Copy from your local PC to remote RDP server,

* Now you can paste the text on the remote computer.
